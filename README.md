### [📖 my book on algorithms and data structure: open-source for you! (2014)](MY_BOOK)

<br>

- **➡️ [one of the first-ever publications solving classic algorithm and data structure problems in python, published by hanbit media](https://www.hanbit.co.kr/store/books/look.php?p_code=B8465804191)**.
- **➡️ [last time i checked, it had 4.6/5 stars and 33 reviews (not bad for a book written in school by a self-taught!)](https://www.hanbit.co.kr/store/books/look.php?p_code=B8465804191)**.
- **➡️ [this repo used to have 600+ stars and 300 forks before 💩 happened 😞 (here is a proof)](MY_BOOK/600_stars.png)**.
- **➡️ [just for fun: this book as a reference for a CMU computer science class](https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/ramesh/teaching/course/48784.pdf)**.

### the zen of phython

```
Beautiful is better than ugly.
Explicit is better than implicit.
Simple is better than complex.
Complex is better than complicated.
Flat is better than nested.
Sparse is better than dense.
Readability counts.
Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
Although practicality beats purity.
Errors should never pass silently.
Unless explicitly silenced.
In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
Now is better than never.
Although never is often better than *right* now.
If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!
```
